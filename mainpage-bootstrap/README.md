## Welcome to EmotiVis
The EmotiVis system aims to satisfy the need for interactive data visualization content-creators to be able to conveniently gather, manage and access relevant user data on their published content. Our client, Professor Lane Harrison of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, notes an increasing investment into the development of interactive data visualizations. Unfortunately, little is known about how each user engages with said content, and how they are reacting to it. Often, content creators are putting in resource draining work in order to develop complicated visualizations, but there is very little information known about the impact of their work. Thus, the purpose of EmotiVis is to bridge the gap between what knowledge is, and isnâ€™t known about data visualizations and their impact.
